Castelldefels is an easy beach escape from Barcelona with plenty of space for kids to run and play. Choose a section of the beach with a nearby playground so you can mix sand play with swings and slides.

Many beachfront restaurants are used to families, so you can plan an early lunch or early dinner and still have time for a final play in the sand before heading back.
