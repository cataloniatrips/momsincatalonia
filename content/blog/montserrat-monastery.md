Montserrat makes a great day trip once your kids are old enough to enjoy a bit of walking and big views. Take the train from Barcelona and then the cable car or rack railway up to the monastery.

Spend some time exploring the basilica area, then choose one of the shorter walking routes with lookout points. Pack snacks and layers, and plan for a relaxed pace with plenty of photo stops.
