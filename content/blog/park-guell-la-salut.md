Park Güell is a playful, colorful stop that works well for younger kids. Start at the main entrance and wander through the mosaic benches and lizard statue, then let the kids explore the open spaces.

After the park, head towards the La Salut neighborhood for a calmer local feel — grab a snack or drink, and give everyone a chance to rest before heading home.
